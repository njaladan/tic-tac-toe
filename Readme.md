# Tic-Tac-Toe
#### A Monte-Carlo Simulator

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple Monte-Carlo based player. A small playing GUI is also included.

This works on a particularly inefficient implementation of the Monte-Carlo methods, so it plays out every single game possible from the given state, and then picks the cell that works best. Originally built for an online class on Python algorithms.
