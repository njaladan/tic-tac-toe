# Tic-Tac-Toe
#### A Monte-Carlo Simulator

So I know that this is technically a "readme", but let's throw the explanation guise out the window and talk about a few questions you might have.

### What is this?
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple tic-tac-toe playing engine I am designing. Currently, it works based on the Monte-Carlo methods. 

### How does it work?
This works on a particularly inefficient implementation of the Monte-Carlo methods, specifically, it plays out every single game possible from the given state, and then picks the cell that works best.

### Y u do dis?
Because it's cool! I'm currently on a mission to create computer players for all sorts of games before moving onto uncharted territory...GGM.

### Who did this?
Me! <cough></cough> That is, Nagaganesh Jaladanki. Check ~~me~~ him out at http://njal.ga/

Gosh, writing in third person is hard.
